README: Python Implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier

This implementation is a Python implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier algorithm, 
which is a simple and effective probabilistic classifier commonly used in machine learning. 
The Naive Bayes classifier is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class.
