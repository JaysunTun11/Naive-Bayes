README: Python Implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier

This implementation is a Python implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier algorithm, 
which is a simple and effective probabilistic classifier commonly used in machine learning. 
The Naive Bayes classifier is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class.

The Naive Bayes algorithm works as follows:

Gather a set of labeled training data, consisting of instances (or examples) each with a set of features and an associated class label.

Calculate the prior probabilities of each class label based on the training data. The prior probability of a class label is simply the proportion of instances in the training data that belong to that class.

For each feature and each class label, calculate the conditional probability of that feature given the class label. This is the probability of observing that feature in an instance of that class.

To classify a new instance, calculate the posterior probability of each class label given the observed features. This involves multiplying together the prior probability of the class and the conditional probabilities of each observed feature, and then normalizing the results to obtain a probability distribution over the class labels.

Choose the class label with the highest posterior probability as the predicted class for the new instance.
